    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2) // 200, 100 not 200, 200

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players; // this is a reference, does not work as a copy
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person // wrong! this makes a reference, not a copy
    // captain.number = 99; // this would add number: 99 to the original person object
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
